## Philippine Peso Counterfeit Bank Note Detector (WIP)

This project aims to develop an Android application for detecting counterfeit Philippine peso banknotes using live object detection with the YOLOv8 machine learning model.

### Important Note
This project is currently under development (WIP) and is for educational purposes only and should not be solely relied upon for real-world counterfeit detection. Counterfeiters are constantly evolving their methods, and this project may not be able to identify all forgeries.

### Getting Started
This project focuses on detecting counterfeit Philippine peso banknotes using YOLOv8 for live object detection. To get started, follow 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/isabeloderek/counterfeitchecker`.
2. Put your .tflite model and .txt label file inside the assets folder
3. Rename paths of your model and labels file in Constants.kt file
4. **Build and Run:**
